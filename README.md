# Ben and Alexis' Vacation Pictures

This website is a collection of pictures from our vacations. It's built with Go and HTMX and very
little JavaScript. It was built as an exploration of what a modern web app with Go and HTMX could
look like.

## Running the App

To run the app, you'll need to have Go installed. You can then run the following commands:

```sh
go run main.go
```

This will start the server on port 8081. You can then visit `http://localhost:8081` in your browser
to see the app.
